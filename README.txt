AliasDataref
================

X-Plane plugin for creating aliases (alternate identifiers) for existing datarefs. This is to circumvent the 58-character limit for dataref identifiers on the Teensy hardware boards. The identifiers of the existing datarefs, and the desired identifier of the new dataref, are listed in a text file and specified by the user.

This is the readme file for programmers compiling/building the project themselves. The user readme is in the ShippingCrate folder. This represents the environment that is zipped up and uploaded to the file archives, minus compiled files.

If you'd like to compile this project for Mac or Linux and let me upload the binary alongside mine at x-plane.org I'd be delighted!
